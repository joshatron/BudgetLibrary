Budget Library
==============

Currently, this is a library for a budget app.
When the library is complete, a full application will be made with the library at the core.
The library imports transactions and transaction partners in a unified data model and provides useful helper functions to manipulate the data.
It is currently designed with one user in mind, though eventually it may be able to handle more.

To Run
------

You will need leiningen installed to run this.
To create a repl for experimentation, run:

    lein repl
    
This library was created with TDD, so to find usage examples, look in the test folder.
